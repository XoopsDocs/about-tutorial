The meaning of individual icons is described below:

| **Icon** |  **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ![](.gitbook/assets/accept.png) | Published represents the interface can be displayed in the foreground |
| ![](.gitbook/assets/delete.png) | Representation stored in the draft does not appear in the front interface |
| ![](.gitbook/assets/page.png) | Indicates that the internal link page |
| ![](.gitbook/assets/page_link.png) | Represents external links page |
| ![](.gitbook/assets/disabled.png) | Expressed not in the foreground appear in the menu interface |
| ![](.gitbook/assets/tick.png) | Denotes a display interface menu in the foreground |

Once you complete your About Us pages, the user might see something like this, as it is done in the default setting:

In front-end the user will see a menu with three options, and the right content \(Company\) and the menu options and no contact is displayed on the home page, which is a big advantage of this module, since you are in the background in the Company's "options menu is displayed in the" in the election of the "No", of course, if you want it displayed in the menu, click on "Yes" to everything is OK.

If you click on the "Key Features", you will see more information. It's also possible to add external links, which will lead you to another Website.
